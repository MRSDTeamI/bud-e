Tested with ROS Hydro.

With Kinect plugged into the USB and powered on.

Install this package under catkin_ws/src/

detect_can - parses the scene for objects (removes planes and noise) then 
returns the first object cluster's center coordinates. The center coordinates 
are passed to a ROS topic.

parse_center - parses the ROS topic of the center coordinates and averages 10 
coordinates to generate 1 main coordinate. After the main coordinate is 
generated, the program monitors the ROS topic for any large changes in 
coordinate, and if the large change persists over 20 readings (~3sec) then it
averages the next 10 coordinates and generates another "main" coordinate. This
main coordinate is sent to a ROS topic.

detect_cylinder - an updated program that specifically parses the scene for
cylindrical objects, much like the original detect_can. This program will,
however, reject objects that are not cylindrical.
